Software Engineering is the designing, developing, testing and maintaining of software systems using computing tools, principles and methodology. 

software development involves analysis, system designing, writing of code, system testing, and system maintenance. in traditional programming, however, merely revolves around coding rather than encompassing all aspects of software production.
Sustainable Development Life Cycle 
Agile vs. Waterfall Models
Waterfall Model: Staged methodology where each phase is clearly defined and follows the previous one. More suitable for projects where it is easy to determine what is required and there is not expected to be much variation. But at the same time it can be not very flexible and can not meet the new requirements as effectively as needed.
Agile Model: This is an Iterative and Incremental approach that focuses on the flexibility that is important in developing software. Ideal for projects where there is a dynamic and changing scope and where time is of the essence. However, its implementation demands the constant engagement of relevant stakeholders and their feedback.
The decision of choosing Agile or Waterfall can only be made based on the nature, size and uncertainty level of the project in question.
Requirements Engineering
Requirements engineering encompasses the processes of requirement elicitation, analysis, documentation, and confirmation. Thus, stakeholders’ needs and expectations are met in the final software product. This process is important bearing in mind that where requirements are not clearly defined or are ambiguous, projects might fail or even be associated with costs more than their estimates.
Software Design Principles
In software architecture, modularity is the process of decomposing a system into more controllable, manageable and reusable components/modules. It also improves on maintainability since changes or additions to one module will not have a ripple effect on the entire system. Moreover, it enhances the issue of scalability as it enables one to include new features or even functionality without having to rewrite much of the code.
Testing in Software Engineering
Software testing is the process of checking and reviewing the software in order to confirm that it is compliant to given quality standards. undefined
1. Unit Testing: Check out individual units or components of software without necessarily interacting with it as a whole.
2. Integration Testing: Check the interface between integrated components/modules.
3. System Testing: Packaging and evaluation of the complete software system.
4. Acceptance Testing: Assuring the user that the software complies with the requirements and is fit for use.
Testing is very important in order to uncover defects, prove software quality and reduce risks due to failures.
Version Control Systems
Version control system are tools that help identify modifications made to source code, facilitate contribution by developers, and enable moving to previous states. Some of them include Git, Subversion, and Mercurial. They are crucial for ensuring code quality and providing communication channels necessary for effective development.
Software Project Management
A software project manager is a professional who coordinates and controls the software project planning and implementation process. These include coordination of resources, management of risks, timing of activities, and coordination with other stakeholders. Challenges can mainly be described as trade-offs, control of scope, and contract alterations.
Software Maintenance
Software maintenance is the process of modifying and improving a software system once it has been released for use in its intended environment. Maintenance can be corrective (eliminates faulty elements), adaptive (if the environment changes), perfective (enhancing its efficiency or convenience), and preventive (averts problems in the future). This is important to keep these systems alive and useful for as long as they can go.
Ethical Implications of Software Development
Some of the ethical considerations in software engineering are as follows; violation of privacy, insecurity, biased software and theft of idea. Ethical ways that software engineers can practice include; The protection and respect for the consumer’s privacy and security, the implementation of transparent and accountable artificial intelligence in decision making, and the issue of patent rights. ACM’s Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct is among the ethical standards that guards ethical conduct in software engineering practice.
